# Solidity Factory Pattern and Inheritance

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates the Factory Pattern and inheritance in Solidity, tested on the Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet.

## Challenges
- Managing contract imports and ensuring correct file paths.
- Resolving function conflicts in multiple inheritance using `super` and `override`.

## Insights
- The Factory Pattern simplifies deploying and managing multiple contract instances.
- Inheritance allows extending functionality but requires careful management of conflicts.

## Setup
- Remix IDE with MetaMask (Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet).
- Deployed using Injected Web3 and tested through Remixâ€™s interface.

## Usage
- Deploy `StorageFactory` to manage instances of `SimpleStorage`.
- Extend functionality with `AdvancedStorage`.
